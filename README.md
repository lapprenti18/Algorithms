# **Algorithms & Big'O Notation**

## **What is an Algorithm:**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step. There is different types of <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; algorithm for differents type of problem. In this I will speak about the most important and fondamental <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; algorithm design paradigms.
<br>
<br>


 ### <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Divide and Conquer Paradigm :</p>
  This paradigm works in 3 differents steps:

  - Step 1:&nbsp; Divide the problem into subproblems of the same type.
  - Step 2:&nbsp; Conquer every subproblems.
  - Step 3:&nbsp; Combine the solutions of the smaller subproblems to obtain the solution
of the bigger problem.

In the most of the Divide and Conquer algorithms with involves recurrence relation

 ### <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Greedy algorithms Paradigm :</p>
Greedy algorithms work on problems which it is true that at every step is a choice that<br>
is optimal for the problem up to that step. And after the last step the algorithm produce<br>
the optimal solution of the complete problem.
<br>
<br>

 ### <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dynamic Programming Paradigm :</p>
This type of algorithm is also known as the memoization technique because in this the<br>
idea is to store the previously calculated result to avoid calculating it again and again.<br>
In Dynamic Programming, divide the complex problem into smaller overlapping subproblems<br>
and storing the result for future use.
